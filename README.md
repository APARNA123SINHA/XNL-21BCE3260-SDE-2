# DataStream - Advanced Real-Time Financial Data Processing Platform

## Project Overview

This project implements an advanced full-stack application for processing real-time financial data and transactions. The system is designed as a microservices architecture that ingests streaming market data, processes transactions, evaluates risks, and generates alerts in real-time using an event-driven architecture.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn-ui, Framer Motion
- **Backend Microservices**: Node.js, Golang, Python
- **APIs & Communication**: GraphQL, REST, WebSockets, gRPC
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, TimescaleDB for time-series data
- **Caching**: Redis
- **Authentication**: JWT, OAuth2, RBAC
- **Infrastructure**: Kubernetes, Docker, AWS, GCP
- **CI/CD**: ArgoCD, GitOps workflow, Automated testing
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack

## Architecture

The system is built around a microservices architecture with the following key components:

### Core Services

1. **Authentication Service**: JWT-based authentication with OAuth2 / OpenID Connect
2. **Market Data Service**: Real-time stock and crypto data ingestion and distribution
3. **Order Matching Engine**: High-performance WebSocket-based order matching
4. **Analytics Service**: Real-time financial analytics and market insights
5. **Portfolio Management**: User portfolio tracking and management
6. **Alerting Service**: Real-time alerts for market conditions and trading signals

### Event-Driven Flow

The system uses an event-driven architecture with the following data flow:

1. Market data is ingested from external sources (Alpaca, Binance, Alpha Vantage)
2. Data is processed and normalized by the Market Data Service
3. Order Matching Engine processes incoming orders against the order book
4. Transactions are recorded using event sourcing patterns
5. Analytics Service processes market data and transactions for insights
6. UI components consume data via GraphQL and WebSocket connections

## Database Design

- **Users**: Authentication and user profile information
- **Orders**: Order details including type, price, quantity, status
- **Transactions**: Executed trades and their details
- **Positions**: Current user portfolio positions
- **Market Data**: Time-series financial data with TimescaleDB hypertables
- **Alerts**: User alerts and notifications

## API Structure

### GraphQL API

- User authentication and profile management
- Portfolio data and analytics
- Market data queries and aggregations

### WebSocket API

- Real-time market data streaming
- Order book updates
- Trade execution notifications
- Live alerts and signals

## Deployment

The application is deployed using a multi-cloud strategy:

- Frontend: Vercel (Next.js SSR) & Cloudflare Pages (Edge)
- Backend: AWS Lambda (for microservices) + Kubernetes (EKS + GKE)
- Database: AWS Aurora Multi-Master / CockroachDB 
- CDN: Cloudflare CDN & Argo Tunnels for secure delivery

## CI/CD Pipeline

- GitOps workflow using ArgoCD
- Infrastructure as Code deployment via Terraform
- Multi-Cluster Management across AWS & GCP
- Automated security scanning with Snyk
- Secrets management with AWS Secrets Manager

## Performance

The system is designed for high performance with:

- Sub-50ms response times for API requests
- Support for 10M+ concurrent users
- Real-time data processing with minimal latency
- Horizontal scaling capability for all services

## Security

- JWT-based authentication with OAuth2
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- mTLS for service-to-service communication
- Regular penetration testing with OWASP ZAP and Burp Suite
